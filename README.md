Flashcards is an App Project made by React during the frontend module of Thinkful Bootcamp.

The app is mobile friendly and responsive. 
Being user based means that everyone can study on this app plus anyone can create, edit, and delete decks and cards via forms.

Each deck must have at least 2 cards; each card - a front and a back.
Once through a deck user will have the option to start over or route back to the home page.

If user arrives on an unknown route a 404 error will appear and it is a treat.
